In a safe neighborhood, rooms were secure, showers were fantastic, etc. I have only the highest marks to give the Finnish Church in London. Only one other place I have stayed at, a catholic music conservatory dormitory in Saltzburg, even came up to this standard. They also have a sauna in the basement. It was free if you are a hostel guest. I only used it once but the experience and conversations in the sauna was excellent.',\n",

       " 'The hostel was easy to find and clearly laid out, the staff were helpful, and the girl that helped me check out was especially friendly. However there were only men’s toilets on my floor so I had to keep going up and down stairs. It was also very difficult to sleep as despite booking a private room I could constantly hear the toilet flushing and the hand dryers as well as doors to other rooms and conversations in other rooms. Fine for one night but I’m glad I wasn’t staying longer.',\n",
       " \"Main problem was the shower situation. Weren't too bad but not super clean, and a bit cramped. There was hooks in 2/3 of the showers, but didn't feel like much space to keep your things while you showered. There was also a few sketchy characters roaming about but that's not unexpected at a hostel. The lighting in our room was also horrendous, in the day you couldn't even tell the lights were on as the room was so dark. But the staff were really friendly and the room/beds were decent.\",\n",

       " 'Relatively cheap Great location The shared bathrooms are sold as \"private\" bathrooms which is misleading No fitted sheets, so sheets came off in the night both nights making for an uncomfortable sleep The cleaner forgot to slide our door bolt in when they closed it leaving it not only unlocked but ajar. Luckily nothing was taken but on the second night we took anything of value with us to the restaurant just in case. A cheaper experience but even then several elements should be improved.',\n",
